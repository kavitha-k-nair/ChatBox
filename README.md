One system can request to start the conversation which can be accepted or denied by the other end-user who waits for any connections. The users can also speak out their messages which gets converted to text and then can be sent. If any amongst two users wish to leave the conversation he/she can do it so by clickig on exit button which immediately informs
the other user that the person has left. (working on updates)
